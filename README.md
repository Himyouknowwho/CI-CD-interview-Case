initial CI/CD pipeline plan

finish source code commit > pass commit stage unit tests > send to builder > build as container or other required artifact > 



Setup:
Create git repo
Install and run jenkins
install Terraform
Install Kubectl and minikube


Commit stage:
Using a client git hook we can automatically trigger unit tests for the system and reject the commit if the tests doesn't pass.
Depending on the testing framework of choice, we can decide if we want to run a full test suite for to verify our entire code coverage, or we can limit the tests to the files changed in the latest commit. Smoke tests is also viable.
